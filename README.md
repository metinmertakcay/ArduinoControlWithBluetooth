## ArduinoControlWithBluetooth ##
Servo motor is used for robot movement and robot's gripper movement. The operation of the servo motors is provided by the android application. The communication between Arduino and android is provided with the bluetooth module(HC-06). Arduino code is available in RobotController.ino. By changing the pin values, the code can be executed. With Android code the bluetooth must be turned on for control of the Arduino. Bluetooth can be opened from the outside, or from within the program. In the program, the surrounding bluetooth modules should be scanned and the device to be connected should be selected. The connection can be made by pressing the connection button in the menu immediately after the selection. A color change will occur on the main screen after the connection is made. Control of the motors can be provided by pressing the buttons on the screen.
